How do I prepare my CPU to be mature enough to get into long mode?

Here's my list of things you need: 
(this list isn't really a guide but more of a reference some things might be wrong you can correct them ofc)

~Paging setup:
First start off with designing your paging. If you want big pages like 1GB or smaller pages. You need to pick the right table for your needs. 
You don't need to have a clear design yet for now. Simply setting the bits PS (to stop the paging walk) read/write and present is doable for now!
Messing with priveleges and protection bits is not needed for now since you probably don't have a userspace anyways.
